===========

Snapshot 0.7.8 (2012-05-06)

* Added DebugTokenizerRunner to generate Viterbi debug output

* Improvements to how dictionary data is located and read/ written:
  No Java serialization is used (classes can be freely renamed or relocated).
  Custom resolvers can be passed to locate dictionary data (and manipulate
  it along the way).

Release 0.7.7 (2012-01-30)

* Improved search mode decompounding heuristic and added unit tests for IPADIC

* Resolved connection costs work-around issue

* Renamed GraphvizFormatter to ViterbiFormatter


Release 0.7.6 (2011-07-12)

* Added preliminary UniDic support.  Download UniDic and build using

    mvn -Dkuromoji.dict.format=unidic \
        -Dkuromoji.dict.dir=unidic-mecab1312src \
        -Dkuromoji.dict.encoding=utf-8 \
        clean package


Release 0.7.5 (2011-04-20)

* Added temporary workaround for IOB exception in ConnectionCosts.

* Made CSV parsing (source dictionary parsing) proper. It now handles quote properly.
  You can now add half-width comma as dictionary entry by quoting it.

* Quote and escape output of getFeature method if necessary when it returns comma separated value(to return more than one feature).

* Added option to DicitonaryBuilder to create NFKC normalized dictionary entry (disabled by default).

* Added a method to Token, which get all features as array rather than CSV.

* Added option to DicitonaryBuilder to specify source dictionary encoding.

* Reduced initial memory usage during dictionary compile.

* Known Issues

  - GraphvizFormatter doesn't count penalty cost in search mode and extended mode
  - GraphvizFormatter doesn't work properly in extended mode


Release 0.7.4 (2011-02-07)

* Added DebugTokenizer to analyze Viterbi

* Modified extended mode behavior so that it now unigrams only unknown words

* Made splitting configurable

* Modified search mode (including extended mode) behavior. It now adds extra cost to non-kanji only nodes too.

* Added boundary checking in DoubleArrayTrie.

* Known Issues

  - GraphvizFormatter doesn't count penalty cost in search mode and extended mode
  - GraphvizFormatter doesn't work properly in extended mode

 
Release 0.7.3 (2011-01-18)

* Modified Tokenizer to reuse dictionaries so that it doesn't throw OOM when
  several Tokenzer instances are created.

* Modified API to get Tokenizer instance. It is instanciated using build()
  method.
